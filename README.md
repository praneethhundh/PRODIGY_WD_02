STOP WATCH
This HTML-based Stopwatch application features a sleek design with Bootstrap for responsiveness and a customizable theme switcher. It includes a prominent header displaying "STOP WATCH", a central timer display showing hours, minutes, seconds, and milliseconds with corresponding labels. Functional buttons allow starting, stopping, and resetting the timer, enhanced with JavaScript for real-time updates and interaction. The application supports both light and dark themes, toggled via a theme switch button. This project highlights fundamental web development skills using HTML, CSS for styling, Bootstrap for layout responsiveness, and JavaScript for dynamic functionality, providing an intuitive and visually appealing user experience for tracking time.
